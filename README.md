### A Journey across fundamental algorithms

In September 2020 I decided I had enough with the usual web-centric stuff and dediced to create some space for new and refreshing coding opportunities.

It did not take too long for me to start browsing the Amazon catalog for good quality books on non-UX oriented programming, having decided to make a step back from the day-to-day coding of Javascript and Ruby stuff and to get back into programming fundamentals. When I think "fundamentals" I mean a place where writing software has - almost - nothing to do with reusing code from libraries and pre-built components or data structures. And this means getting back to basic programming logic, data scructures and - alas! - getting as close as possible to the CPU.

I therefore brushed off my old K&R's ANSI C book and started writing basic linked lists and manipulating arrays. Fun. Lots of it. But I was not learning much: at the end of the day, good old ANSI C did not change much from thirty-five years ago (yep, I did program in C on a Commodore Amiga 500 in my teens!) and, although interesting, I was sorta feeling I could mix my personal research with some novelty factors such as, for instance, a programming language I sorta-knew about but have not much of a chance to use in my day job.

I picked Python. And love every bit of it.

It's kind of unstructured and works well in both structured as well as object-oriented programming. I requires a lot of discipline to write good code because it's far too easy to make a mess out of it. But when you apply some basic common sense or even a real clean-code approach while writing Python code, the result may be beautiful.

A level of clarity that is way higher than, say, C (and BTW I love C and, to an extent, C++).

I therefore started converting my first basic algorithms originally written in C to Python and created a small GUi, the TkTestHarness, with the Python Tk/Tcl library, TkInter. Honestly, I'd have gone with GTK+ 3.0 but the GTK+ Python library is not available for the Linux distribution I'm using for my experiments. A shame, the GTK+ widgets are quite beautiful on a GNOME desktop and TkInter does not match that level of polished appearance. It only kinda comes close.

Anyway, this repo collects my journey on fundamental algorithms written in Python on a basic testharness GUI application.

And it's a fun journey, for sure.
